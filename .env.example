# SharePoint MCP Configuration Example
# Copy this file to .env if you want to store credentials (not recommended for production)

# Azure AD Application Credentials
CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id-here

# SharePoint Site URL
SITE_URL=https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/yoursite

# OAuth Redirect URI (should match Azure AD app configuration)
